# TOP_EmbeddingImagesAndVideo

The project is to recreate Youtube video page and the main purpose is to use iframe tag to insert video into webpages. 

What I learned from the project.
- Getting more familier with flexbox and grid in CSS
- More comfortable with HTML structure
- svg is needed to apply fill property in the CSS file in order to display color
